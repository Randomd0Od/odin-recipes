  <h1>Irish Coffee</h1>
  
  This just has four simple ingredients to use, so it can be made fairly quick.  It also pairs well with
  rolling green hills and cold foggy mornings!

  <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 onces of your favorite whiskey</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup of freshly brewed coffee, 6 - 8 onces</li>
      <li>Heavy cream, slightly whipped</li>
      <li>Tea kettle of near boiling water (optional)</li>
    </ul>
  
    <ul>
      <li>If you are using the tea kettle, get the water hot first and pour it into the cup.  Let stand for
         about a minute, and discard the water.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Pour about 2/3 of the coffee in to the cup, and add the brown sugar.  Stir until disolved and 
        pour in the rest of the coffee
      </li>
      <li>Pour in the whiskey and stir gently</li>
      <li>Gently pour the heavy cream over the back of a spoon, into the hot coffee.  This will help the 
        cream float on top of the coffee.  Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
